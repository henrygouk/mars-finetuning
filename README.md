Fine-Tuning with MARS Distance Constraints
==========================================

This repo contains the code used for conducting experiments in the paper [Distance-Based Regularisation of Deep Networks for Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08253).

The code uses the keras API bundled with tensorflow, and has been tested with the official TF 2.1 docker image. See the `scripts/` directory for examples of how to use `finetune.py`.
